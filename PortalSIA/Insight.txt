PART THAT NEEDS ODD AND EVEN = REPORT, SCORING SESSION, SUBJECT SCORE, ABSENT RECAPITULATION, EXTRACURRICULAR SCORE
PART THAT DEPENDS ON ODD ONLY = HOMEROOM CLASS, SUBJECT, EXTRACURRICULAR, TAKING & TEACHING EXTRACURRICULAR, TEACHING SUBJECT


DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ODD SEMESTER REPORT AND EVEN SEMESTER REPORT IS ONLY ON THE DECISION IF THE STUDENT SHOULD BE PROMOTED


STEPS TO DEFINE NEW HOMEROOM TEACHER (ADMIN PRIVILEGE) & ADD STUDENT HOMEROOM CLASS (TEACHER PRIVILEGE)
    - ADMIN MUST CREATE NEW SCHOOL YEAR FIRST
    - ADMIN GO TO CLASS LIST AND STUDENTS LIST SHOULD BE EMPTY AND SELECT NEW HOMEROOM TEACHER FOR THAT CLASS
    
    !!!! THAT'S WHY ADMIN PRIVILEGE TO CREATE NEW SCHOOL YEAR IS VERY INFLUENTIAL, IT AFFECTS STUDENT AND TEACHER TO FOLLOW NEWEST SCHOOL YEAR
    !!!! AND IT'S NOT ADVISED TO DELETE A SCHOOL YEAR WHILE A TEACHER IS LOGGED IN, IT WILL CAUSE AN ERROR

    - WHEN INVOLVED TEACHER LOG IN, HE/SHE SHOULD SEE A HOMEROOM CLASS MENU AND SCHOOL YEAR LIST FOR MOST CURRENT SCHOOL YEAR

    !!!! PREVIOUS TEACHER SHOULD PROMOTE THEIR STUDENTS IN EVEN SEMESTER

    - A BUTTON TO PROMOTE STUDENT MUST BE CREATED ON THE LIST FOR EVEN SEMESTER ONLY WHICH CONTAINS NEW HOMEROOM CLASS AND ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY

    - THE STUDENT LIST SHOULD BE EMPTY IF PREVIOUS TEACHER DOESN'T PROMOTE HIS/HER STUDENTS
    - IF THE PREVIOUS TEACHER HAS PROMOTED THEIR STUDENTS, THE LIST SHOULD BE UPDATED BASED ON MOST CURRENT SCHOOL YEAR
